# Space Explorers
[Space Explorers](https://space-explorers.herokuapp.com/) is a space themed role playing game based in the near future. It uses a MongoDB, Express, React front-end and Node.js. We utilize the google maps Image Type Api to create the planets with custom info markers and icons. The state is persisted using local storage and cookies, so a user can easily save progress, load their last player and play where they left off.
